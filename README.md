# Drug Discovery using Machine Learning and Data Analysis
Acetylcholinesterase is one of the most vital drug targets for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease which is a chronic neurodegenerative disease causing memory loss and cognitive abilities in elderly people.
The inhibition of Acetylcholine (ACh) in cholinergic neurons can hinder synaptic depression and block ACh hydrolysis. Screening inhibitors for AChE enzymes have already gained some success with three commercial drugs approved by the FDA including donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine.
In this project, a machine learning model is built using bioactivity data of Acetylcholinesterase obtained from the ChEMBL database by installing the the ChEMBL web service package.
