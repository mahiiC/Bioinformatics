# Bioinformatics
Genome replication is one of the most crucial tasks carried out in a cell. This occurs right before cell division occurs and as a result of it, the genetic material
gets replicated so that it can be equally divided into the two daughter cells.
This project aims to mimic DNA replication algorithmically and analyze the underlying biological process
STEP #1 : Finding the ori site (origin of replication)
